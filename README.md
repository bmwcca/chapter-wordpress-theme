# chapter-wordpress-theme

This repository contains the WordPress theme for BMW CCA chapters using the centralized hosting option offered by the Technology Committee. The Committee has developed this theme to create a unified brand experience for all chapters who opt-in to the centralized hosting option.

If your chapter is interested in simplifying the hosting of their website, please review the [presentation](https://cdn.bmwcca.org/prod/s3fs-public/content/media/docs/BMW_CCA_Tech_Committee-2017_Congress_Presentation.pdf) made at the 2017 Chapter Congress, and reach out to the Technology Committee.

###### PLEASE NOTE
Any chapter may use this theme on their website without opting in to centralized hosting. However, please understand that if you install it on your own host, the Committee will provide no support for its installation or maintenance.
